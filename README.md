# Surfacebook-AutoHotkey
An Auto-hotkey script to make the Surface Book more developer / user friendly. More changes will follow soon ;p  

## Bindings  

**Touchpad**  
* Three Finger Tap = Middle Click  
* Four Finger Tap = Win + UP  
  
**Media Keys**  
* Win + LAlt + SPACE = Play/ Pause  
* Win + LAlt + UP = Volume Up  
* Win + LAlt + DOWN = Volume Down  
* Win + LAlt + m = Mute Volume  
* Win + LAlt + LEFT = Previous Media  
* Win + LAlt + Right = Next Media  
  
**Keys**  
* LAlt = HOME  
* Appskey = END 
 * _They play nice with shift keys now_
* Swaps F7 - F12 to its Fn equivalents, Vice versa. 
 * _remove ";" in line 27 - 32 to use this feature_
  
**Notes**  
* Fn + Del / Backspace is screen brightness by default so I didn’t bother adding that.  
* You might want to disable default three finger and four finger taps in touchpad settings so it doesn’t turn on Cortana.  
* Suggestions are welcome :D Have a good day!  
  
##Future Updates  
* Four Finger Tap = Max and Min active window depending on its state.  
* Four Finger Left Swipe = Snap active window to the left.  
* Four Finger Right Swipe = Snap active window to the right.
